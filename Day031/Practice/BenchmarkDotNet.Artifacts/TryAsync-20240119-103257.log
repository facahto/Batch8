// Validating benchmarks:
// Benchmark TryAsync.MyMethod: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `MyMethod` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.

// Benchmark TryAsync.MyMethod2: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `MyMethod2` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.

//    * Assembly Practice which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
If you want to debug the benchmarks, please see https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/guides/troubleshooting.html#debugging-benchmarks.
